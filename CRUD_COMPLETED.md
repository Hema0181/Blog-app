# Summary of Fixes for Profile Image and Bio Display Issue

## Background
The user reported that after updating their profile, the profile image and bio were not showing on the profile page.

## Root Cause
- The Django settings lacked configuration for serving media files (MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT).
- The project URLs did not include media file serving during development.
- The profile view did not pass the Profile instance to the template context.
- The profile template expected a `profile` variable to access profile_picture and bio fields.

## Changes Made

1. **blogproject/settings.py**
   - Added:
     ```python
     MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
     MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
     ```

2. **blogproject/urls.py**
   - Added media file serving in development mode:
     ```python
     from django.conf import settings
     from django.conf.urls.static import static

     if settings.DEBUG:
         urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
     ```

3. **blog/views.py**
   - Updated `profile_view` to include the user's Profile instance in the context:
     ```python
     @login_required
     def profile_view(request):
         user_posts = Post.objects.filter(author=request.user).order_by("-created_at")
         try:
             profile = request.user.profile
         except:
             from .models import Profile
             profile = Profile.objects.create(user=request.user)
         return render(request, "blogs/profile.html", {"user_posts": user_posts, "profile": profile})
     ```

4. **blog/templates/blogs/profile.html**
   - Adjusted template to use `profile.profile_picture.url` and `profile.bio` for displaying image and bio.
   - Updated display name to use `profile.user.first_name` and `profile.user.last_name`.

## Testing
- Manual testing confirmed profile image and bio display correctly after update.
- Automated tests for edit profile form submission and profile page load passed successfully.

## Location of Changes
- `blogproject/settings.py`
- `blogproject/urls.py`
- `blog/views.py`
- `blog/templates/blogs/profile.html`

## Next Steps
- Continue with thorough testing if desired.
- Deploy changes to production with proper media file handling setup.
